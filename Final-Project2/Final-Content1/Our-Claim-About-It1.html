				We think Hugo's Downfall has been heavily censored, the reason is because it has an E for everyone rating.

			</p>

			<p>
				Which is something see you online almost never does. It is always at least T for teens.
			</p>

			<p>
				The amount of crossover characters it has though is most likely one of the reasons.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because most of the characters come from mostly family friendly franchises.

			<p>
				Now the fact it is rated E for everyone isn't the strangest thing.
			</p>

			<p>
				Something that is pretty strange though is Hugo's Uprising had a T for teen rating.
			</p>

			<p>
				You think something that comes after would be rated higher or The same as last time.
			</p>

			<p>
				So the fact this case is a lower rating is really strange.
			</p>

		</div>

		<div id="thrid">
			<p>
				The ratings these games get are very accurate a lot of the time.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sometimes though they push it the rating. Like having more blood than usual.
			</p>

			<p>
				The only sure thing is they are very all over the place with it.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is just the fact that it is tamer than the first game. As well as being E, it really shows something went wrong here.
