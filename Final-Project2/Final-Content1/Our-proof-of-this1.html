		<div id="first">

			<p>
				So there are a lot of hints in this game this Darker Version exists.

			</p>

			<p>
				We will go over the biggest things we found to prove this point.
			</p>

			<p>
				There of course many more examples but these are just the ones we found.
			</p>

		<div id="second">

			<p>
				This Character is called Skelagon.
				He is the biggest example of a draker version.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because he isn't in the gameplay. Just cut-scenes.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sounds like they cut him out of most of it because he was too intense of a character.
			</p>

			<p>
				I mean look at him. He looks too intense for a family game.
			</p>

		<div id="thrid">
			<p>
				This next part is an important plot point that doesn't get expalined.
			</p>

			<p>
				Skelagon infects Hugo with a spirit of some kind.
			</p>

			<p>
				This makes Hugo do evil stuff sometimes. Which is something he normally won't do.
			</p>

			<p>
				A good example of that spirit taking over is this scene.
			</p>

		</div>

		<div id="fourth">

			<p>
				This scene he grabs the other villain he works with by the neck.
			</p>

			<p>
				Hugo then flies upwards with him to a height where it would kill him if dropped
			</p>

			<p>
				He then gets out his sword then drops him.
			</p>

			<p>
				If there was a darker version, it could be Hugo uses his sword then drops him.
			</p>

		</div>

	</main>

	<main>



		<div id="faith">

			<p>
				For this scene Hugo is angry with the same villain he works with for failing him.
			</p>

			<p>
				So Hugo gets out his sword. He then says "You need to be punished for failing."
			</p>

			<p>
				This part Hugo hurts the other villain with his sword.
			</p>

			<img src="Site-Img/Hugo-Stabbing.png" />
			<figcaption>
				Made by Lucas Wold using starry ai

		</div>

		<div id="sixth">

			<p>
				This scene goes black and white because the screen becomes darker.
			</p>

			<p>
				Then right before Hugo stabs the guy the screen goes fully black and we hear a scream.
			</p>

			<p>
				If this wasn't censored it would most likely show him stabing him.
			</p>

			<p>
				The other villain has an armcast the rest of the game though so this scene isn't pointless.
			</p>

		<div id="seventh">

			<p>
				These 3 are the biggest examples of this game being censored that we found.
			</p>

			<p>
				There of course are more examples of this. There is way more than this.
			</p>

			<p>
				These 3 are just the biggest ones to us.
			</p>

			<p>
				You can search the game itself to see way more of this.
				There is a lot if you look for it.
