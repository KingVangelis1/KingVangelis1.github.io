			<p>
				The Company that made Hugo's Downfall is called: See You Online Studios.
				They are behind great games like Gears Of Steam, Science Of War,
				the Trilogy A Flame's Spirit, and lastly Hugo's uprising.

		<div id="special3">
			<p>
				See You Online have a great track record with their games.
				They release fully finished games always. Which is very rare because most release half finshed games.
				All of their games are great at storytelling and gameplay. I have no idea how they are great at both.

			<p>
				The only downside is pretty much all their games appeal to different age groups.
				Like Gears of steam has hearts being ripped out.
				Meanwhile Science Of War if you pick the bad ending they imply the kill your character and don't show how.
				The ESRB ratings for their games either range from E for everyone to M for mature.
				They will not commit on picking one to stick with.
