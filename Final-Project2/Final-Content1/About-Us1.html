			<p>
				What do we do here? We try to find a deeper side of media to show you the stuff they try to hide.

			</p>

			<p>
				So we try to take typically family friendly stuff and show you it isn't that simple.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because of course things are never as it seems.
			</p>

			<p>
				Everything has more grey parts then black and white parts.
			</p>

		</div>

		<div id="second">

			<p>
				Now since we show the darker side of things so much we also do the reverse.
			</p>

			<p>
				That means we take stuff that is very dark and try to lighten it up.
			</p>

			<p>
				So we try to highlight the postive elements of really dark things. Like Game Of Thrones.
			</p>

			<p>
				Where there is light there must be shadow. So we don't upset the balance we give both.
			</p>

		</div>

		<div id="thrid">
			<p>
				So here we show you a balance of showing you the dark and the light.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because things are never as balck and white as they seem.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is always more shades of grey in there.
			</p>

			<p>
				No matter how colorful something is, almost always it is not that simple.
