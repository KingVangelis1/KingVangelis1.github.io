					For all his faithfulness and heroics over the years, R2-D2 deserves the top spot, from being Anakin Skywalker's right-hand to aiding the Resistance when the time is right.
					He has the best elements of every droid mixed into one, from his strong companionship to his constant sassiness that would surely need censorship if Binary was able to be more easily translated.
					R2 is a key agent in the Rebellion's first major win against the Empire in the Galactic Civil War, recruiting both Luke and Obi-Wan to the cause. The Star Wars galaxy simply wouldn't be the same without R2, and thankfully, there's still plenty of time left for R2 to continue making his galactic impact as new stories are told.

					<p>
						Although R2-D2 is maybe one of the most iconic Droids in the galaxy, he isn't my top spot for droids that can't speak basic. That title has to go to BD-1 from Jedi Fallen Order and Jedi Survior.
						Since though he appears in two video games, it is kinda hard not to like him because you can customize him to your liking. He is a very useful droid that can do a lot, from allowing you to use
						ziplines to healing you. He clearly loves the character you play as and it he has such a great design. Also it gives the games a sense of you are not alone on this journey. The biggest part is
						it gives the main character someone to talk to.
