			<h1>How the Internet has changed for better and worse</h1>

				So the internet as a whole has changed a lot since the 1990s. To the point where if you compare the modern day internet to the 1990 version it would be pretty much unrecognizable apart from the fact it still gives answers to questions.
				This connects to an article I know of called: 404 page not found by Kate Wagner. Where she explains how the internet has changed drastically.
			</p>

			<p>
				One of her major points is that everyone says <em>“Be careful what you post online because it’ll be there forever.”</em> Kate is mainly trying to prove that statement wrong.
				Basically the main point is everything ages on the internet and after it becomes a certain age it starts to get erased or turned into something else meant to latch onto your nostalgia for it, although the actual thing it is coming from has been taken completely out of context.
			</p>

			<p>
				Kate mainly proved her point of nothing on the internet is permanent by telling about her myspace page. I guess she wasn’t lying about being on the web in the 1990s. She mentioned that her myspace account with a bunch of others profiles were completely erased with no way to get that back. She compares this to a mini burning of the Library of Alexandria.
				That might be a small exaggeration though. Definitely bad for people who were way more informational with their accounts, but for most that use profiles for their intended purpose this isn’t that big of an issue. It definitely is a problem though they erased so much of the users personal information. Basically it is we can give you anything you want but if we feel like it we can take it away at any time without your input.
			</p>

			<p>
				She also highlights that because everything nowadays attaches to optimizing performance, things have actually become more restrictive than before. Like you can’t change what the app looks like, you can’t change your profile that much, you aren’t allowed to say certain things. All that kind of stuff.
				Honestly I completely agree with her point. Everything is so minimal now and things kinda blend together and not one stands out. She highlights the quote <em>“Capitalism will obliterate everything you know and love.”</em> Although the subject is the internet this line basically applies to any kind of media that exists.

				The major social media sites she mentioned were x formally known as twitter, tumblr and reddit. A lot of users on those are younger people that just love to complain. So all three of those but especially twitter are just filled with hating on everything. The only time I see something positive is when it is 100% perfect. Which is practically never.
				It is either the best thing ever or the worst thing ever, there isn’t a rank that can go in between those. With all the hate comments, the fact most of them are really boring, and those really restrictive rules, it really becomes more obvious that pretty much everyone has one kind of social media and it has replaced their life.
			</p>

			<p>
				So in conclusion the internet started as a niche thing that took some looking to get the answers you wanted. It slowly became though you get the answers you want but it filled with a good amount of fake stuff as well. As well as the charming interfaces that the early internet had slowly lost all personality those had.
				As well as everything moves so fast nowadays that information quickly becomes outdated and can be deleted at any time. Also really strict rules and actually lets you do less than you were able to before. So in very few ways the internet has evolved but has devolved in many more ways.
