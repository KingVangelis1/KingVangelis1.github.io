			This is early concept art of a character named Skelagon with a character known as Luna. Skelagon is my own orginal character who is a humanoid 
			skeleton dragon. The main skills this shows is that I have ideas for characters, their stories, and also mechanics for games. 
		</p>

		<p>
			This also shows I am adapatable because both of these characteres have changed a lot from this concept based on what is better.
			So this shows I am open to the idea of changing the story and characters based on what others want.

			Here is a kinda popular theory about the mario series. Like all fan theorys none of them are happy
			and just trying to ruin stuff you like. Because nintendo is a very family friendly company most of the time
			they will never talk about this. Unless this idea makes it into a fan game, then they go to shoot to kill.

			Now this a kinda well known theroy about the coins in the Mario series.
			This is very relavent because Hugo's Downfall does feature Mario and Luigi but,
			seems to leave out any traces of coins. Which is strange because the currency from the other series are here too.
		</p>

		<p>
			Seems like the coins are missing from both Hugo games because of the implications it would give the game. 
			It is a coin problem because both Hugo games have rupees, rings and credits.
			Very strange it only has 3 currencys out of the 4 well known franchies that are in this game.
			Unless this was done intentionally to ward off any parts of this being darker than it seems.
