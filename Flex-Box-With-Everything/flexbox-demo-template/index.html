			This is early concept art of a character named Skelagon with a character known as Luna. Skelagon is my own orginal character who is a humanoid 
			skeleton dragon. The main skills this shows is that I have ideas for characters, their stories, and also mechanics for games. 
		</p>

		<p>
			This also shows I am adapatable because both of these characteres have changed a lot from this concept based on what is better.
			So this shows I am open to the idea of changing the story and characters based on what others want.

			Here is my finished version of Skelagon that I created with Zbrush. The version that I am happy with. 
			As you can see it is very different from the concept.
			I also have expereince with unity, 3D max, Maya and Photoshop.

			Now there was quite a lot of skills needed to make this. The first was I needed was how to paint color onto the model. 
			The second was most of this is human skeleton work so I had to do a lot of referencing to make sure it matched up with how that normally works. 
			The skull and the wings I had no reference for apart from what I think it should look like. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Now I individually make the pieces themselves so they had a huge poly count, so I had to majorly reduce the ploys without losing detail so it didn't need too much power.
			The last thing was I needed to create a turntable for this. 
			Now the only criticism I had when I finished this was he wanted a turntable of just the skull because he found that to be the most impressive.
