		<p>
			This is early concept art of Skelagon with Luna. Luna was supposedly the name of Hugo's wife. Now Luna
			isn't in the game and is only mentioned, sounds to me like Skelagon did something to her.
		</p>

		<p>
			I say sounds to me because like this whole there is a darker version thing
			See you Online Studios has refused to say anything about it. Hugo's downfall
			though has only been out for a week though so that might change.

			Here is a kinda popular theory about the mario series. Like all fan theorys none of them are happy
			and just trying to ruin stuff you like. Because nintendo is a very family friendly company most of the time
			they will never talk about this. Unless this idea makes it into a fan game, then they go to shoot to kill.

		<p>
			Now this a kinda well known theroy about the coins in the Mario series.
			This is very relavent because Hugo's Downfall does feature Mario and Luigi but,
			seems to leave out any traces of coins. Which is strange because the currency from the other series are here too.
		</p>

		<p>
			Seems like the coins are missing from both Hugo games because of the implications it would give the game. 
			It is a coin problem because both Hugo games have rupees, rings and credits.
			Very strange it only has 3 currencys out of the 4 well known franchies that are in this game.
			Unless this was done intentionally to ward off any parts of this being darker than it seems.
