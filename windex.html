                Although the game company See You Online Studios has only been around for about 7 years, they really ended up proving that they are a very trustworthy company to make consistently great games. The only other company nowadays that is still able to do that is Nintendo. Practically every other game company only releases games where there are at least 5 glitches on day one of being released. To make things worse,  they won’t actually fix all the issues you have for sometimes up to 5 years. Reality is that games cost so much nowadays that fixes rarely happen.

                See You Online Studios has made great games like Gears of Steam, Science Of War, and the trilogy A Flame’s Spirit. These are all great games, and they were created with various levels of appropriateness. On the one hand, Gears Of Steam was given a very justified M for mature rating. I have experienced a funny response from people complaining about there being mature content in a game rated M for mature. It is almost like a rating means something.  
                On the other extreme, Science Of War is rated E for everyone even though it has glimpses of darker content. I can understand someone complaining about that rating. Finally, A Flame’s Spirit trilogy was rated T for teen games. The reasoning behind this rating was because the story throughout the trilogy was a bit intense for younger audiences, but not insane enough for older audiences.

                See You Online Games has a new game called Hugo’s Uprising, and it’s sequel Hugo’s Downfall. One would think that the sequel would have the same or increased rating than the initial game. However, Hugo’s Uprising was given an E 10+ because of some semi-intense content, and Hugo’s Downfall, the sequel, was given an E for everyone rating. 
                The strange thing is there seems like there are a lot of hints in online communication on forums that there might exist a version of the game that isn’t E for everyone. When asked about this rating adjustment, the studio seemed to acknowledge the theory while refusing to tell us more.  Is there a darker version of Hugo’s Downfall?  The company admitted that if they get 30 million people to get to VIP member status, they might get access to the darker version, but still won’t commit to that verification. To become a VIP member, one must pay 5 dollars. 
                In reality, we have no idea what that means. Some people do not believe that there is a darker version of Hugo’s Downfall. So let me prove it to you.

                All proof points to the fact that a darker version can exist. I am about to spoil the game for you, so I will give you an opportunity to click off now if you don’t want to be spoiled.
                So let’s dive in.  First off, one of the biggest draws of the marketing was that there were more crossovers than the first game.  Secondly, a new character was introduced called Skelagon. Hugo actually made him an extremely long time ago.  Hugo trapped him and now reawakened him. Skelagon was a humanoid skeleton dragon hybrid creature like the one depicted below.

            </figure>



            <p>
                Skelagon was introduced at the end of Hugo’s Uprising as a terrifying character and functioned as a teaser for the sequel. Due to  his violent nature, Skelagon only appears in cutscenes.
                He doesn’t exist in the gameplay because that would be too intense for an E for everyone game. There is even a chase sequence with him where he is chasing you, but it gets cut short, and it isn’t really a chase.

            </p>

            <p>
                There is also a plot thread where Skelagon infects Hugo with something that makes Hugo act really out of character at certain points. For example, there is a scene where Hugo is holding a different villain by the neck. They are both really high in the air and Hugo gets out his sword. Then he doesn’t use his sword and instead drops the other villain. 
                This implies the dedication of the creator to ensure that this game is censored enough to maintain an E for everyone rating. It also implies the ability to create a darker version, perhaps for those with VIP status. 
                But this is yet to be seen, and is just my theory at this point. These are just two big examples of the existence of a darker version, but there are many more hints in the game that I don’t have time to get into in this article. You can probably find them yourself.
