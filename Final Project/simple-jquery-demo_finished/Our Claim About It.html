			We think Hugo's Downfall has been heavily censored, the reason is because it has an E for everyone rating.

		</p>

		<p>
			Which is something see you online almost never does. It is always at least T for teens.
		</p>

		<p>
			The amount of crossover characters it has though is most likely one of the reasons.
		</p>

		<p>
			Because most of the characters come from mostly family friendly franchises.

	<div id="second">

		<p>
			Now since we show the darker side of things so much we also do the reverse.
		</p>

		<p>
			That means we take stuff that is very dark and try to lighten it up.
		</p>

		<p>
			So we try to highlight the postive elements of really dark things. Like Game Of Thrones.
		</p>

		<p>
			Where there is light there must be shadow. So we don't upset the balance we give both.
		</p>

	</div>

	<div id="thrid">
		<p>
			So here we show you a balance of showing you the dark and the light.
		</p>

		<p>
			Because things are never as black and white as they seem.
		</p>

		<p>
			There is always more shades of grey in there.
		</p>

		<p>
			No matter how colorful something is, almost always it is not that simple.
