				We think Hugo's Downfall has been heavily censored, the reason is because it has an E for everyone rating.

			</p>

			<p>
				Which is something see you online almost never does. It is always at least T for teens.
			</p>

			<p>
				The amount of crossover characters it has though is most likely one of the reasons.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because most of the characters come from mostly family friendly franchises.

				Now since we show the darker side of things so much we also do the reverse.
			</p>

			<p>
				That means we take stuff that is very dark and try to lighten it up.
			</p>

			<p>
				So we try to highlight the postive elements of really dark things. Like Game Of Thrones.
			</p>

			<p>
				Where there is light there must be shadow. So we don't upset the balance we give both.
			</p>

		</div>

		<div id="thrid">
			<p>
				So here we show you a balance of showing you the dark and the light.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because things are never as black and white as they seem.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is always more shades of grey in there.
			</p>

			<p>
				No matter how colorful something is, almost always it is not that simple.
