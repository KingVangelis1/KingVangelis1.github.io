				<p>
					What do we do here? We try to find a deeper side of media to show you the stuff they try to hide.

				</p>

				<p>
					So we try to take typically family friendly stuff and show you it isn't that simple.
				</p>

				<p>
					Because of course things are never as it seems.
				</p>

				<p>
					Everything has more grey parts then black and white parts.
				</p>

			</div>

			<div id="second">

				<p>
					Now since we show the darker side of things so much we also do the reverse.
				</p>

				<p>
					That means we take stuff that is very dark and try to lighten it up.
				</p>

				<p>
					So we try to highlight the postive elements of really dark things. Like Game Of Thrones.
				</p>

				<p>
					Where there is light there must be shadow. So we don't upset the balance we give both.
				</p>

			</div>

			<div id="thrid">
				<p>
					So here we show you a balance of showing you the dark and the light.
				</p>

				<p>
					Because things are never as balck and white as they seem.
				</p>

				<p>
					There is always more shades of grey in there.
				</p>

				<p>
					No matter how colorful something is, almost always it is not that simple.
