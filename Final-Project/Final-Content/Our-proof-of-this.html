	<div id="first">

		<p>
			So there are a lot of hints in this game this Darker Version exists.

		</p>

		<p>
			We will go over the biggest things we found to prove this point.
		</p>

		<p>
			There of course many more examples but these are just the ones we found.
		</p>

	</div>

	<div id="second">

		<p>
			This Character is called Skelagon.
			He is the biggest example of a draker version.
		</p>

		<p>
			Because he isn't in the gameplay. Just cut-scenes.
		</p>

		<p>
			Sounds like they cut him out of most of it because he was too intense of a character.
		</p>

		<p>
			I mean look at him. He looks too intense for a family game.
		</p>

	</div>

	<div id="thrid">
		<p>
			This next part is an important plot point that doesn't get expalined.
		</p>

		<p>
			Skelagon infects Hugo with a spirit of some kind.
		</p>

		<p>
			This makes Hugo do evil stuff sometimes. Which is something he normally won't do.
		</p>

		<p>
			A good example of that spirit taking over is this scene.
		</p>
	</div>

	<figure>
		<img src="Site-Img/Hugo-Grabbing.png" />
	</figure>

	<div id="fourth">

		<p>
			This scene he grabs the other villain he works with by the neck.
		</p>

		<p>
			Hugo then flies upwards with him to a height where it would kill him if dropped
		</p>

		<p>
			He then gets out his sword then drops him.
		</p>

		<p>
			If there was a darker version, it could be Hugo uses his sword then drops him.
		</p>

	</div>

	<div id="faith">

		<p>
			For this scene Hugo is angry with the same villain he works with for failing him.
		</p>

		<p>
			So Hugo gets out his sword. He then says "You need to be punished for failing."
		</p>

		<p>
			This part Hugo hurts the other villain with his sword.
		</p>

	</div>


	<figure>
		<img src="Site-Img/Hugo-Stabbing.png" />
	</figure>

	<div id="sixth">

		<p>
			This scene goes black and white because the screen becomes darker.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then right before Hugo stabs the guy the screen goes fully black and we hear a scream.
		</p>

		<p>
			If this wasn't censored it would most likely show him stabing him.
		</p>

		<p>
			The other villain has an armcast the rest of the game though so this scene isn't pointless.
		</p>

	</div>

	<div id="seventh">

		<p>
			These 3 are the biggest examples of this game being censored that we found.
		</p>

		<p>
			There of course are more examples of this. There is way more than this.
		</p>

		<p>
			These 3 are just the biggest ones to us.
		</p>

		<p>
			You can search the game itself to see way more of this.
			There is a lot if you look for it.
